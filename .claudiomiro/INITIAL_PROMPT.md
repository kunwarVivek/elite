Understand the project from prd and frds and exisitng code. Build and deploy the current platform on docker.. think deep.. do the real RCA and then fix the real issue .. not the symptons.. and the debugging and fix should be bottoms up (considering specs/prd as sources of truth ->schema->backend->frontend ->deployment). Focus on functional and technical completion and not exhaustive testing setup.Test only critical flow. Pareto's principles in each planning and tasks. Get this platform working end to end. Check the existing code before doing anything
